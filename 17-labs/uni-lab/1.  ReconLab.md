# a) How many IPs currently live in the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet?
nmap -Pn -n 192.168.2.0/26 --open -F -oG up1.txt -vv 
nmap -Pn -n 192.168.2.64/26 --open -F -oG up2.txt -vv 
nmap -Pn -n 192.168.2.128/26 --open -F -oG up3.txt -vv 
nmap -Pn -n 192.168.2.192/26 --open -F -oG up4.txt -vv 
cat up* | grep Up | awk -F “ “ ‘{print $2}’ > host.txt

# -Pn : treats all targets as up even if ping isnt
# -n : no dns resolution
# -F : fast (top 100 ports)
# -oG : grepable output
# Note: Doing simultaneously to save time


# b) How many of the IPs are running Linux OS and how many are running Windows OS? 

# At this stage OS guess can be ambiguous - can check be nb-ssn or smbd (but samba can be run on both)

nmap -Pn -n -p139,445 -iL host.txt -sV --script nbstat, smb-os-discovery –open -oN OS.txt


# c) Specify the names of at least 4 of the live machines. 

# nbtscan 192.168.2.0/24
ALDRUHN, CALDERA, GNISIS, FOREST

# d) How many Domain Controllers are currently live in the 192.168 subnet and what are their names? 

# Domain controllers manage security auth within a windows domain - Active Directory uses default ports 389 for LDAP and 636 for LDAPs
nmap -Pn -n -p389,636 -sV --open -oN domain.txt 192.168.2.0/24

# e) What is/are the name/s of the domain/s currently active in the 192.168 subnet? 

192.168.2.x (10,12,50)
10 - BALMORA
12 -
50 - TOMEASDC






f) Which version of Windows is running on each of the domain controllers? g) How many Windows 2012 server systems are present in the CRS? h) How many Windows XP systems are present in the domains? i) How many Linux CentOS systems are present in the domains? j) How many systems currently live in the 192.168 subnet are running FTP services? k) How many systems currently live in the 192.168 subnets running TFTP services? l) Are there more than two systems currently live in the 192.168 subnets that are running database services? m)How many systems currently live in the 192.168 subnet running websites? Are there any systems running more than one website? n) Specify whether any systems are providing NFS shares and if they do, specify the share. o) Which machine is named Dagol-Fel (specify the IP address)? p) Which domain is the largest (in terms of live machines)?


```






**Part 2

a) Specify which system has the largest number of ports open. b) Specify the IPs of the machines running SSH services. c) Specify whether or not there is a machine running XAMPP currently live in the CRS. d) Specify whether or not there is a machine running MS-SQL2016 currently live in the CRS. e) Specify the IPs of at least two machines that allow anonymous FTP. Explain how you determine whether or not anonymous access is allowed. f) Specify whether or not there is a machine running MySQL in the CRS. g) Specify the FQDN name for the domain controllers that live in the CRS. h) Which of the live systems in the cyber range could be used as domain controllers? i) How many systems are running RDP in the CRS?
