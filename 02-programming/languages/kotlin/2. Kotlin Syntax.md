## Overview

##### **Semicolons:**

Kotlin does not require semicolons at the end of a line or statement. The compiler automatically detects the end of a statement based on line breaks and the syntax.

```Kotlin
val name = "Alice"
val age = 25
println("Name: $name, Age: $age)
```


Semicolons are only required if you want to put multiple statements on the same line.

```Kotlin 
val name = "Alice"; val age = 25; println("Name: $name, Age: $age)
```

##### **Kotlin Variables:**
Kotlin has two main ways to declare variables


| **Keyword** | **Mutability**        | **Descriptin**                            |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| val         | Immutable (read-only) | Value cannot be reassigned once set       |
| var         | Mutable (read-write)  | Value can be changes after initialisation |

```Kotlin
val name = "Jesse" //Immutable: cannot change later
var age = 20 //Mutable: can change
```

Reassigning a `val` causes an error
```Kotlin
val country = "Australia"
country = "France" //Error: Val cannot be reassigned
```


##### **Kotlin Variables and Initialisation**

A `val` is immutable and cannot be changed after initialisation. It must be initialised when declared.  
```Kotlin
val age: Int = 25
val name = "John"
```

A `var` is mutable. It must also be initialised when declared.
```Kotlin
var count: Int = 10
var message = "hello world"
```

Kotlin does allow for Late Initialisation (lateinit). This is used when you want to declare a non-null mutable property but delay its initialisation. Only applicable for `var` properties.

**lateinit** cannot be used with primitive types like Int, Boolean, etc.

```Kotlin
lateinit var description: String

fun setup() {
	description = "Hello World"
}
```


##### **Kotlin Brain Teaser**
``` Kotlin
// What is the output of each main function?

// A
fun main() {
	val a = 5
	val b = "5"
	println (a + b)
}

// V
fun main() {
	val x = "3"
	val y = 3
	println( x == y.toString())
}

```

Answer: 
A outputs `55` - because the integer `a` is concatenated with string `5`
B outputs `true` - because `y.toString()` returns `"3"` which equals `x`. In Kotlin, == compares values, not references (unlike Java's == for objects).


##### **Kotlin Nullable Variables**

In Kotlin, you can declare variables that can hold a null values using the ? operator. You can initialise these variables later or set them to null.

```Kotlin
var name: String? = null
var age: Int? = null
fun initialiseVariables() {
	name = "Jesse"
	age = 20
}
```
