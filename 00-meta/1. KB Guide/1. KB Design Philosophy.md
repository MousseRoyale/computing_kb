## Overview

- **Purpose:** Define the guiding principles for structuring, creating, and maintaining a computing and cybersecurity knowledge base. Ensure it is **scalable, intuitive, and easy to navigate**.

- **Scope:** Applies to all notes, folders, tags, templates, and workflows in the KB. Covers atomic note design, topic-first organization, tagging, cross-linking, and metadata usage.


## Key Sections

- **Atomic Notes:** Every note should cover **one concept, tool, procedure, reference, or practical** to maintain clarity, reusability, and ease of linking.

- **Topic-First Organization:** Folders are organized by **subject/domain** (e.g., security, programming, AI), while note types and difficulty are handled with **tags and metadata**, not folder structure.

- **Templates:** Use predefined templates for each type (concept, tool, procedure, reference, practical) to ensure consistency. Templates include frontmatter for type, domain, difficulty, tags, author, and version.

- **Tagging Strategy:**

    - **Type tags:** `#concept`, `#tool`, `#procedure`, `#reference`, `#practical`
    
    - **Topic tags:** `#cryptography`, `#web-security`, `#ai-ml`, etc.
    
    - **Difficulty tags:** `#beginner`, `#intermediate`, `#advanced`, `#expert`
    
    - Combine these for powerful filtering and search. Use **nested tags** if needed `#security/offensive/web`).

- **Cross-Linking:** Always link related concepts, procedures, and practicals using `[[ ]]` syntax to enable **graph view discoverability** and learning paths.

- **Metadata/Properties:** All notes include YAML frontmatter to store key fields (title, type, domain, difficulty, tags, author, version, status). Optional inline hashtags can supplement visibility.

- **Learning Paths / MOCs:** Use `INDEX.md` notes in each domain folder as **maps of content**, showing beginner → intermediate → advanced progression and grouping by type.


## Quick Reference / Checklist

-  Each note covers **one atomic idea**
-  Use **topic-first folder** organization
-  Apply **template appropriate to note type**
-  Fill in **frontmatter properties**: type, domain, difficulty, tags, author, status
-  Add **inline or nested tags** for visibility/search
-  Cross-link related notes
-  Use `INDEX.md` for domain MOC and navigation
-  Maintain consistent naming conventions: `YYYY-MM-DD_[type]_[topic].md`

## Implementation Notes

- Keep notes **small and focused** for scalability.
- Avoid creating new folders for note types; rely on **tags and frontmatter** to classify type.
- Regularly review **MOCs and indexes** to ensure navigation remains intuitive.
- Follow templates to maintain consistency across all domains.
- Use **GitHub and Obsidian search** with tags to quickly find notes by type, topic, or difficulty.
