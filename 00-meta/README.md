Welcome to my Computing & Cybersecurity Knowledge Base, a public repository of my computing journey.


This is a work in progress that will be updated gradually when I am able to transfer my existing notes over to this new format. Hopefully it provides you with something of value. 

If you have any suggestions please reach out to me. Potentially in making this an open source knowledge repository of computing fundamentals for when it gets more established.
