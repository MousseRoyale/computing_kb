# Contributing to the Computing Knowledge Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This repository aims to be a structured, open source knowledge base. To maintain clarity and usefulness, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Repository Structure
- Organise notes by topic/folder (e.g., `01-Fundamentals`, `02-Tools`, `03-Cloud`).
- Use consistent naming conventions for files, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` or `topic_short.md`.
- Include `.gitkeep` or `README.md` in empty folders to preserve structure.

## 2. Note Formatting
- Use Markdown for all content.
- Headings should follow a logical hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Include tags and internal links where relevant to improve navigation.
- Optionally, use front matter metadata for key details (e.g., author, date, category).

## 3. Types of Contributors
This project welcomes a variety of contributions, including:

1. **Structure & Admin Contributors**
