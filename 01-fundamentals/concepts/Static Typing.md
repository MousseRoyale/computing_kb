## Overview
Statically-Typing is when Type Checking happens at compile-time rather than runtime. 

In statically-typed languages, the variable type is often declared when created:
```kotlin
val age: Int = 25
```

However, modern languages often allow **type inference** : where type is automatically determined based on assigned values.

```Kotlin
val age = 25 //Type inferred as Int
```
