# Open Source Computing Knowledge Repository

Welcome! This repository is an open source knowledge base for all things computing. Original designed for Obsidian. I guess we will see where this goes. 

I will gradually start transferring key learnings, spanning several years, into this repository. The goal is to create a knowledge resource that is **atomic, navigable, scalable, and ultimately helpful** for anyone exploring computing topics.

This project is very much a work in progress, and I would greatly appreciate contributions to help:

- Add new information
- Edit existing content
- Categorise knowledge effectively
- Improve the structure and organisation
- Develop standardised layouts and guidelines for notes

Whether youâ€™re an expert, student, or hobbyist, your input can help make this repository a practical and structured resource for everyone.
